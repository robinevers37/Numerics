Good use of git with good commit messages

You should have a .gitignore file so that you don't add binary files such as .pyc files to the repository

Do not leave my teaching comments:
# If you are using Python 2.7 rather than Python 3, import various
# functions from Python 3 such as to use real number division
# rather than integer division. ie 3/2  = 1.5  rather than 3/2 = 1
#from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function
at the top of files

In FTBS you do not need:
phiOld[(j)%nx]
If you did need to do modulo arithmetic, 
phiOld[j%nx]
would be better. But you don't need modulo arithmetic for this one so 
phiOld[j]
is better.

In CTCS, you need to do one time step of FTCS, before nt-1 time steps of CTCS

In BTCS, do not invert matrix M. This becomes prohibitively expensive for large models. Use 
phi = nplinalg.solve(M, phi)
instead. 

You will need to calculate more diagnostics analysing the behaviour of your schemes.

Also use the square wave initial conditions to compare how different schemes advect discontinuities.

You should also implement one of the schemes from chapter 6 of the notes to show that schemes exist that can do better than CTCS and FTBS
